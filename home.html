            <h2>Why BCIS?</h2>
            <P>BCIS graduates often end up with careers like:</P>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Analytics</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cyber Security</li>
                <br>
                <li>IT Managment</li>
                <br>
                <li>Software Developer</li>
                <br>  
            </ul>
             <p>Through courses in software development, cybersecurity, database management, project coordination, and business analysis, BCIS students graduate
                with the ability to understand both the technical and operational sides of a company. This makes them especially valuable in real-world roles where
                problem-solving and communication are just as important as coding and configuring systems.</p>
