            <p><img src="images/pexels-yankrukov-9072394.jpg" alt="Gaming setup" class="floatright"> We compete in multiple popular titles like Marvel Rivals, Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, 
                and Overwatch. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive environment where both new and experienced players can grow their skills, build lasting friendships, 
                and take on tournaments together as a team. As students in the Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (BCIS) program at Mount Royal University, club members 
                have the opportunity to apply classrom knowledge in a fastpace team based setting. Roles such as team captains, Organizers, and Social Media Leads offer 
                valuable leadership experience, helping students build project management, communication and technical skills.
                Whether you're looking to improve your gameplay or develop  career skills, eSports Club MRU supports your growth on and off the screen.</p>
